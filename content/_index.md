I am a **junior** at **Cornell University**, pursuing a degree in **computer science**. This summer, I had the opportunity to further my skills as a **software engineer intern** at **Humana**. During high school, I conducted research on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** with Princeton University. I have a strong understanding of **full-stack web development** and proficiency in various programming languages, operating systems, and frameworks. Apart from coding, I enjoy rock climbing and hiking.
