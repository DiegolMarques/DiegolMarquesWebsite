This MERN CRUD website was generated using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/home) for the database, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the server, [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front end, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Currently, the website runs locally, but in the future it will be hosted via [netlify hosting](https://www.netlify.com/). The github page for the frontend and local server can be found here: [Gratitude Front End](https://github.com/DiegolMarques/gratitudeJournalWebsite) / [Local Server](https://github.com/DiegolMarques/gratitudeJournalServer)
